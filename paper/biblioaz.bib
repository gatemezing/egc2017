  abstract = {Simple conceptual graphs are considered as the kernel of most knowledge representation formalisms built upon Sowa's model. Reasoning in this model can be expressed by a graph homomorphism called projection, whose semantics is usually given in terms of positive, conjunctive, existential FOL. We present here a family of extensions of this model, based on rules and constraints, keeping graph homomorphism as the basic operation. We focus on the formal definitions of the different models obtained, including their operational semantics and relationships with FOL, and we analyze the decidability and complexity of the associated problems (consistency and deduction). As soon as rules are involved in reasonings, these problems are not decidable, but we exhibit a condition under which they fall in the polynomial hierarchy. These results extend and complete the ones already published by the authors. Moreover we systematically study the complexity of some particular cases obtained by restricting the form of constraints and/or rules.},

Numerous papers have lobbied for one or another variety of representation, other papers have argued for various properties a representation should have, while still others have focused on properties that are important to the notion of representation in general. In this paper we go back to basics to address the question directly. We believe that the answer can best be understood in terms of five important and distinctly different roles that a representation plays, each of which places different and at times conflicting demands on the properties a representation should have. We argue that keeping in mind all five of these roles provides a usefully broad perspective that sheds light on some longstanding disputes and can invigorate both research and practice in the field.}

  abstract = {In order to tackle the need of sharing knowledge within and across organisational boundaries, the last decade has seen researchers both in academia and industry advocating for the use of ontologies as a means for providing a shared understanding of common domains. But with the generalised use of large distributed environments such as the World Wide Web came the proliferation of many different ontologies, even for the same or similar domain, hence setting forth a new need of sharing - that of sharing ontologies. In addition, if visions such as the Semantic Web are ever going to become a reality, it will be necessary to provide as much automated support as possible to the task of mapping different ontologies. Although many efforts in ontology mapping have already been carried out, we have noticed that few of them are based on strong theoretical grounds and on principled methodologies. Furthermore, many of them are based only on syntactical criteria. In this paper we present a theory and method for automated ontology mapping based on channel theory, a mathematical theory of semantic information flow. We successfully applied our method to a large-scale scenario involving the mapping of several different ontologies of computer science departments from various UK universities.},

This distributed nature of ontology development has led to a large number of ontologies covering overlapping domains.

These suite provides users with a uniform framework for comparing, aligning, and merging ontologies, maintaining versions, translating between different formalisms. Two of the tools in the suite support semi-automatic ontology merging: IPROMPT is an interactive ontology-merging tool that guides the user through the merging process, presenting him with suggestions for next steps and identifying inconsistencies and potential problems. ANCHORPROMPT uses a graph structure of ontologies to find correlation between concepts and to provide additional information for IPROMPT.},

  abstract = {Knowledge-based systems in the Semantic Web era can make use of the power of the Semantic Web languages and technologies, in particular those related to ontologies. Recent research has shown that user-defined data types are very useful for Semantic Web and ontology applications. The W3C Semantic Web Best Practices and Development Working Group has set up a task force to address this issue. Very recently, OWL-Eu and OWL-E, two decidable extensions of the W3C standard ontology language OWL DL, have been proposed to support customized data types and customized data type predicates, respectively. In this paper, we propose a flexible reasoning architecture for these two expressive Semantic Web ontology languages and describe our prototype implementation of the reasoning architecture, based on the well-known FaCT DL reasoner, which witnesses the two key flexibility features of our proposed architecture: 1) It allows users to define their own data types and data type predicates based on built-in ones and 2) new data type reasoners can be added into the architecture without having to change the concept reasoner.},

They allow reasoning about individuals and well de¯ned concepts, i.e. set of individuals with common properties. The experience in using DLs in applications has shown that in many cases we would like to extend their capabilities. In particular, their use in the context of Multimedia Information Retrieval (MIR) leads to the convincement that such DLs should allow the treatment of the inherent imprecision in multimedia object content representation and retrieval. In this paper we will present a fuzzy extension of ALC, combining Zadeh's fuzzy logic with a classical DL. In particular, concepts becomes fuzzy and, thus, reasoning about imprecise concepts is supported. We will de¯ne its syntax, its semantics, describe its properties and present a constraint propagation calculus for reasoning in it.},

These combinations can naturally be embedded into C2, the two variable fragment of predicate logic with counting quantifiers, which yields decidability in NExpTime. We show that this approach leads to an optimal solution for ALCQI, as ALCQI with cardinality restrictions has the same complexity as C2 (NExpTime-complete). In contrast, we show that for ALCQ, the problem can be solved in ExpTime. This result is obtained by a reduction of reasoning with cardinality restrictions to reasoning with the (in general weaker) terminological formalism of general axioms for ALCQ extended with nominals. Using the same reduction, we show that, for the extension of ALCQI with nominals, reasoning with general axioms is a NExpTime-complete problem. Finally, we sharpen this result and show that pure concept satisfiability for ALCQI with nominals is NExpTime-complete. Without nominals, this problem   	is known to be PSpace-complete.},

  abstract = {Description Logics are a family of knowledge representation languages that have been studied extensively in Artificial Intelligence over the last two decades. They are embodied in several knowledge-based systems and are used to develop various real-life applications. The Description Logic Handbook provides a thorough account of the subject, covering all aspects of research in this field, namely: theory, implementation, and applications. Its appeal will be broad, ranging from more theoretically-oriented readers, to those with more practically-oriented interests who need a sound and modern understanding of knowledge representation systems based on Description Logics. The chapters are written by some of the most prominent researchers in the field, introducing the basic technical material before taking the reader to the current state of the subject, and including comprehensive guides to the literature. In sum, the book will serve as a unique reference for the subject, and can also be used for self-study or in conjunction with Knowledge Representation and Artificial Intelligence courses.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the notion of query answering in a distributed knowledge based system, and gives methods for computing these answers in certain cases. More precisely, given a distributed system (DS) of ontologies and ontology mappings (or bridge rules) written in Distributed Description Logics (DDL), distributed answers are defined for queries written in terms of one particular ontology. These answers may contain individuals from different ABoxes. To compute these answers, the paper provides an algorithm that reduce the problem of distributed query answering to local query answering. This algorithm is proved correct but not complete in the general case.},

  keywords = {modular web rule bases, local semantics, local closed-world and open-world assumptions, scoped negation-as-failure},
  abstract = {We present a principled framework for modular web rule bases, called MWeb. According to this framework, each predicate defined in a rule base is characterized by its defining reasoning mode, scope, and exporting rule base list. Each predicate used in a rule base is characterized by its requesting reasoning mode and importing rule base list. For valid MWeb modular rule bases S, the MWebAS and MWebWFS semantics of each rule base s in S w.r.t. S are defined, model-theoretically. These semantics extend the answer set semantics (AS) and the well-founded semantics with explicit negation (WFSX) on ELPs, respectively, keeping all of their semantical and computational characteristics. Our framework supports: (i) local semantics and different points of view, (ii) local closed-world and open-world assumptions, (iii) scoped negation-as-failure, (iv) restricted propagation of local inconsistencies, and (v) monotonicity of reasoning, for “fully shared” predicates.}

This paper presents a concrete tool that incorporates an approach to ontology modularization that inherits some of the main principles from object-oriented software engineering, which are encapsulation and information hiding. What motivated us to track that direction is the fact that most ontology approaches to the problem focus on linking ontologies (or modules) rather than building modules that can encapsulate foreign parts of ontologies (or other modules) that can be managed more easily.}

  abstract = {Ontology engineering on the web requires a well-defined ontology module system that allows sharing knowledge. This involves declaring modules that expose their content through an interface which hides the way concepts are modeled. We provide a straightforward syntax for such modules which is mainly based on ontology alignments. We show how to adapt a generic semantics of alignments so that it accounts for the hiding of non-exported elements, but honor the semantics of the encapsulated ontologies. The generality of this framework allows modules to be reused within different contexts built upon various logical formalisms.},

  abstract = {DRAOn is a distributed reasoner which offers inference services for a network of OWL ontologies correlated by alignments. Reasoning with such networks of ontologies depends on the semantics we define for alignments with respect to ontologies. DRAOn supports two semantics for a network of ontologies: the standard Description Logics (DL) semantics for non-distributed reasoning, and the Integrated Distributed Description Logics (IDDL) semantics for distributed reasoning. Unlike the DL semantics where alignments are considered as inter-ontology axioms, the IDDL semantics interprets alignments as correspondences enabling to propagate non-emptiness (always satisfiable) and unsatisfiability of atomic concepts from an ontology to another one. Consequently, this makes distributed reasoning for a network of ontologies possible since consistency of the whole network can be decided from consistency of each ontology with axioms built from alignments such that these axioms ensure just necessary propagations of knowledge.}

We demonstrate the value of such a framework by comparing our approach to previously proposed extensions of SPARQL and show that AnQL generalises and extends them.}

  abstract = {Healthcare applications are complex in the way data and schemas are organised in their internal systems. Widely deployed healthcare standards like Health Level Seven (HL7) V2 are designed using flexible schemas which allow several choices when constructing clinical messages. The recently emerged HL7 V3 has a centrally consistent information model that controls terminologies and concepts shared by V3 applications. V3 information models are arranged in several layers (abstract to concrete layers). V2 and V3 systems raise interoperability challenges: firstly, how to exchange clinical messages between V2 and V3 applications, and secondly, how to integrate globally defined clinical concepts with locally constructed concepts. The use of ontologies for interoperable healthcare applications has been advocated by domain and knowledge representation specialists. This paper addresses two main areas of an ontology-based integration framework: (1) an ontology building methodology for the HL7 standard where ontologies are developed in separated global and local layers; and (2) aligning V2 and V3 ontologies. We propose solutions that: (1) provide a semi-automatic mechanism to build HL7 ontologies; (2) provide a semi-automatic mechanism to align HL7 ontologies and transform underlying clinical messages. The proposed methodology has developed HL7 ontologies of 300 concepts in average for each version. These ontologies and their alignments are deployed and evaluated under a semantically-enabled healthcare integration framework.}

More precisely, it offers the possibility to formally describe the semantic relations that exist between two ontologies in a networked knowledge-based system. Contrary to Distributed Description Logics \cite{Borgida_Serafini:02}, it is possible to compose correspondences ($\approx$ bridge rules), while still being able to hide some of the discrepancies between ontologies. Moreover, when ontologies have no nominals, no A-Box axioms, and correspondences are restricted to cross-ontology subsumption, the satisfiability of a local ontology is not influenced by ontology alignments and other ontologies, \ie local deduction is invariant to the change of the outer system. Although we do not have a complete reasoning procedure, we provide inference rules and semantic properties, and a discussion on reasoning in this formalism.},

  abstract = {An ontology alignment is the expression of relations between different ontologies. In order to view alignments independently from the language expressing ontologies and from the techniques used for finding the alignments, we use a category-theoretical model in which ontologies are the objects. We introduce a categorical structure, called V-alignment, made of a pair of morphisms with a common domain having the ontologies as codomain. This structure serves to design an algebra that describes formally what are ontology merging, alignment composition, union and intersection using categorical constructions. This enables combining alignments of various provenance. Although the desirable properties of this algebra make such abstract manipulation of V-alignments very simple, it is practically not well fitted for expressing complex alignments: expressing subsumption between entities of two different ontologies demands the definition of non-standard categories of ontologies. We consider two approaches to solve this problem. The first one extends the notion of V-alignments to a more complex structure called W-alignments: a formalization of alignments relying on "bridge axioms." The second one relies on an elaborate concrete category of ontologies that offers high expressive power. We show that these two extensions have different advantages that may be exploited in different contexts (viz., merging, composing, joining or meeting): the first one efficiently processes ontology merging thanks to the possible use of categorical institution theory, while the second one benefits from the simplicity of the algebra of V-alignments.},

  abstract = {In the context of the Semantic Web or semantic peer to peer systems, many ontologies may exist and be developed independently. Ontology alignments help integrating, mediating or reasoning with a system of networked ontologies. Though different formalisms have already been defined to reason with such systems, they do not consider ontology alignments as first class objects designed by third party ontology matching systems. Correspondences between ontologies are often asserted from an external point of view encompassing both ontologies. We study consistency checking in a network of aligned ontologies represented in Integrated Distributed Description Logics (\newddl). This formalism treats local knowledge (ontologies) and global knowledge (inter-ontology semantic relations, \ie alignments) separately by distinguishing local interpretations and global interpretation so that local systems do not need to directly connect to each other. We consequently devise a correct and complete algorithm which, although being far from tractacle, has interesting properties: it is independent from the local logics expressing ontologies by encapsulating local reasoners. This shows that consistency of a \newddl\ system is decidable whenever consistency of the local logics is decidable. Moreover, the expressiveness of local logics does not need to be known as long as local reasoners can handle at least $\mathcal{ALC}$.}

 abstract = {The need for semantics preserving integration of complex data has been widely recognized in the healthcare domain. While standards such as Health Level Seven (HL7) have been developed in this direction, they have mostly been applied in limited, controlled environments, still being used incoherently across countries, organizations, or hospitals. In a more mobile and global society, data and knowledge are going to be commonly exchanged between various systems at Web scale. Specialists in this domain have increasingly argued in favor of using Semantic Web technologies for modeling healthcare data in a well formalized way. This paper provides a reality check in how far current Semantic Web standards can tackle interoperability issues arising in such systems driven by the modeling of concrete use cases on exchanging clinical data and practices. Recognizing the insufficiency of standard OWL to model our scenario, we survey theoretical approaches to extend OWL by modularity and context towards handling heterogeneity in Semantic-Web-enabled health care and life sciences (HCLS) systems. We come to the conclusion that none of these approaches addresses all of our use case heterogeneity aspects in its entirety. We finally sketch paths on how better approaches could be devised by combining several existing techniques.}

Against this background, this paper motivates the need for collaborative environments for ontology construction, sharing, and usage; identifies the desiderata of such environments; and proposes package based description logics (P-DL) that extend classic description logic (DL) based ontology languages to support modularity and (selective) knowledge hiding. In P-DL, each ontology consists of packages (or modules) with well-defined interfaces. Each package encapsulates a closely related set of terms and relations between terms. Together, these terms and relations represent the ontological commitments about a small, coherent part of the universe of discourse. Packages can be hierarchically nested, thereby imposing an organizational structure on the ontology. Package-based ontologies also allow creators of packages to exert control over the visibility of each term or relation within the package thereby allowing the selective sharing (or conversely, hiding) of ontological commitments captured by a package.}

Several related problems and conjectures will be discussed. A secondary aim is to clarify the terminology used to describe CTs and to establish a general conceptual framework applicable to any CT whatever relations are involved. One of the main advantages of using CTs is that they can lead to tractable computation of significant classes of inference. An important aspect of our proposed research programme is to separate computational from purely logical issues and then to systematically investigate relationships between logical and computational complexity.},

  abstract = {In order to evaluate ontology matching algorithms it is necessary to confront them with test ontologies and to compare the results with some reference. The most prominent comparison criteria are precision and recall originating from information retrieval. Precision and recall are thought of as some degree of correction and completeness of results. However, when the objects to compare are semantically defined, like ontologies and alignments, it can happen that a fully correct alignment has low precision. This is due to the restricted set-theoretic foundation of these measures. Drawing on previous syntactic generalizations of precision and recall, semantically justified measures that satisfy maximal precision and maximal recall for correct and complete alignments is proposed. These new measures are compatible with classical precision and recall and can be computed.},

We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are discussed, and alternative representation choices and evaluated against the design criteria.},

  abstract = {Ontology concerns itself with the representation of the objects in the universe and the web of their various connections. The traditional task of ontologists has been to extract from this tangle a single ordered structure, in the form of a tree or lattice. This structure consists of the terms that represent the objects, and the relationships that represent connections between objects. Recent work in ontology goes so far as to consider several distinct, superimposed structures, which each represent a classification of the universe according to a particular criterion. Our purpose is to defer the task of globally classifying terms and relationships. Instead, we focus on composing them for use as we need them. We define contexts to be our unit of encapsulation for ontologies, and use a rule-based algebra to compose novel ontological structures within them. We separate context from concept, the unit of ontological abstraction. Also, we distinguish composition from subsumption, or containment...},

The problem is that the transformed queries might lose some information from the original one, as continuously traveling p2p networks.

In this paper, we propose semantic centrality (SC) measurement meaning the power of semantic bridging on semantic p2p environment. Thereby, we want to build semantically cohesive user subgroups, and find out the best peers for query transformation, i.e., minimizing information loss. We have shown an example for retrieving image resources annotated on p2p environment by using query transformation based on SC.},

  abstract = {As ontologies become ever more important for semantically-rich information exchange and a crucial element for supporting knowledge sharing in a large distributed environment, like the Web, the demand for sharing them increases accordingly. One way of achieving this ambitious goal is to provide mechanised ways for mapping and merging ontologies. This has been the focus of recent research in knowledge engineering. However, we observe a dearth of mapping methods that are based on a strong theoretical ground, are easy to replicate in different settings, and use semantically-rich mechanisms for performing ontology mapping. In this paper, we aim to fill in these gaps with a method we propose for Information-Flow-based ontology mapping. Our method draws on the proven theoretical ground of Information Flow and channel theory, and we provide a systematic and mechanised methodology for deploying it on a distributed environment to perform ontology mapping among a variety of different ontologies. We applied our method at a large-scale experiment of mapping five ontologies modelling Computer Science departments in five UK Universities. We elaborate on a theory for ontology mapping, analyse the mechanised steps of applying it, and assess its ontology mapping results.},

Additionally, the content of the Web is increasing tremendously in size and variety. Yet, many devices do not embed support for all types of media and formats. Therefore, in order to provide as much information as possible to all kind of devices, media items have to be adapted. In this paper, we propose to adapt them by replacing incompatible media items by others found on the Web. The adapted media items must convey the same message as the original ones, while satisfying the target profile. We present a possible architecture to implement this and we show that search engines can already achieve this to a limited extent. Nonetheless, some results are unsatisfactory because media annotations lack semantics, are partial and are heterogeneous. Hence, we propose to use Semantic Web technologies, such as RDF descriptions, ontologies, ontology merging and matching, in order to select better alternatives, thus improving this adaptation framework.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION To compose large scale software there has to be agreement about the terms, since our models depend on symbolic linkages among the components. In modestly-sized systems, we implicitly count on such an agreement. Within a specific domain terms are indeed likely to be consistent, so that specifications can be developed from English (or other natural) language source documents. When combined with a coherent framework we have the underpinnings for a Domain-Specific-Software Architecture DSSA). In this abstract we propose extending concepts used in object-based structural algebras and DSSA research to a knowledge-based algebra, suitable for composing larger systems that span multiple domains. The principal operations in the algebras are simple and provide for selection from the objects in the source domain space and placing them into new domains that represent the information needed for the composed results.},

  abstract = {In the context of the Semantic Web or semantic P2P systems, many ontologies may exist and be developed independently. Ontology alignments help integrating, mediating or simply reasoning with a system of networked ontologies. Though different formalisms have already been defined to reason with such systems, they do not consider ontology alignments as first class objects designed by third party ontology matching systems. Correspondences between ontologies are often asserted from an external point of view encompassing both ontologies. We propose a formalism, Integrated Distributed Description Logics (\newddl), which treats local knowledge (ontologies) and global knowledge (inter-ontology semantic relations, \ie alignments) separately by distinguishing local interpretations and global interpretation. In this report, we identify relevant requirements for the semantics of such distributed systems. From this analysis, we argue that \newddl\ complies with these requirements. We then present a reasoning procedure for \newddl\ systems which uses local reasoners in a modular way. It proves that consistency of a \newddl\ system is decidable iff consistency of the local logics is decidable and it provides an upper bound for the complexity of consistency checking.}

  title = {{Mixed Specification Logic}},
  keywords = {Mixed Formal Specifications, Denotational Semantics, Logic, Institution, Refinement},
  abstract = {Abstract. Separation of concerns or aspects is nowadays recognized as an important issue in software engineering, both at the programming and at the design/specification level. The goal of mixed specification languages is to take into account all- or at least several- aspects of systems. We found out from our experience that a lot of mixed specification languages do share most of their features. However, specific theories, such as the symbolic transition systems one, still have to be studied for several families of mixed specification languages. In this paper we propose a logic for mixed specifications that aims at providing a proposal to give an abstract denotational semantics for mixed specification languages. This logic enables one to reason about a specification at a high level, abstracting away from implementation details and without targetting a specific (often initial) model. We show how our logic can be seen as an institution, which has the benefits of enabling a refinement theory for mixed specifications.}
